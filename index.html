				<h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
					<div class="half-width">
						<p>I've made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island with my small growing family. My journey into tech
						started with a degree in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>
					</div>
						
					<div class="half-width">
						<p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website,
						I realized I found something that gave me the freedom &amp; versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've
						made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write
						clean, elegant code.</p>

					<img src="img/icon-html.png" alt="HTML icon"/>
					<!-- had to add the break as nothing I did with the h3 width adjusted all three columns correctly -->
					<h3>Hand-Coded <br>HTML</h3>
					<p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read,
					easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>
				</div><!-- end of third-width one -->
				
				<div class="third-width">
					<img src="img/icon-css.png" alt="CSS icon"/>
					<h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
					<p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load,
					and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
				</div><!-- end of third-width two -->

					<h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>
